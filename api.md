# API documentation

This is the API documentation for the arcdps-clears friend server.

## General concepts

The API always returns the entire state, which should replace the old state in the consumer. The exception to this is
during errors, see individual endpoints for instructions on how to handle those.

This allows multiple instances consuming the API running in parallel to synchronize their status, which is useful when
multiboxing.

### Subtokens

This API makes heavy use of GW2 API [subtokens](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/API:2/createsubtoken). Make sure you
are familiar with this feature.

### Authentication

As the addon allows using multiple keys, the authentication method also uses multiple keys.
This is done by providing `x-auth-keys` as a header with a comma-separated list of key hashes.
Alternatively, you may provide multiple `x-auth-keys` headers, each containing one key hash.
Do not combine these two approaches, commas are ignored if specifying multiple headers.

The key hashes are effectively passwords, and should be generated by `SHA256(api_key)`. Knowledge of this hash allows
you to manipulate any data associated with it (such as related subtokens).

While it is not enforced by the API, you should only associate subtokens of api key *A* with the hash of
*A* to avoid confusing users. Using the hash of *A* as the password also has the benefit of no extra storage being
necessary.

Note that the hashes also identify keys in responses.

### Friend subtokens

The API is used to get subtokens that may be used to request clears of your friends from the API. These subtokens are
heavily restricted. They have a short expiration time (a day or so) to make it possible to revoke access for users
without deleting an API key. You may have to request the key again when it expires.

They keys only allow the following endpoints:

- /v2/account/masteries – used to access the `last_modified` information with minimal information leaks about the
  account.
- /v2/account/raids – used to access raid clear data

Note that in future, more endpoints may be added to support new features (such dungeon clears and similar).

## State

The *state* is returned as an answer to all successful requests, as JSON.

The following example assume that two keys were used in `x-auth-keys`:
`01ba4719c80b6fe911b091a7c05124b64eeece964e09c058ef8f9805daca546b,4355a46b19d348dc2f57c046f8ef63d4538ebb936000f3c9ee954a27460dd865`
.

The `keys` section contains the state of keys included in `x-auth-keys`. The `friends` section includes subtokens for
clears shared with any of the keys included in `x-auth-keys`.

### Example: before adding subtokens

Note that no friends may be retrieved before adding a subtoken, as it is needed to verify the account name.

```json
{
  "keys": [
    {
      "key_hash": "01ba4719c80b6fe911b091a7c05124b64eeece964e09c058ef8f9805daca546b",
      "shared_to": [],
      "subtoken_added_at": null,
      "subtoken_expires_at": null,
      "account": null
    },
    {
      "key_hash": "4355a46b19d348dc2f57c046f8ef63d4538ebb936000f3c9ee954a27460dd865",
      "shared_to": [],
      "subtoken_added_at": null,
      "subtoken_expires_at": null,
      "account": null
    }
  ],
  "friends": []
}
```

### Example: with subtokens and shared

Both accounts have a subtoken added, first account is also shared to two friends.
One of these friends does not have a subtoken available.

```json
{
  "keys": [
    {
      "key_hash": "01ba4719c80b6fe911b091a7c05124b64eeece964e09c058ef8f9805daca546b",
      "shared_to": [
        {
          "account": "Account.1234",
          "added_at": "2020-04-28T16:29:04.644008111Z",
          "account_available": true
        },
        {
          "account": "Account.5678",
          "added_at": "2020-04-29T16:29:04.644008111Z",
          "account_available": false
        }
      ],
      "subtoken_added_at": "2020-03-28T16:29:04.644008111Z",
      "subtoken_expires_at": "2021-03-28T16:29:04.644008111Z",
      "account": "OurAccount.1234"
    },
    {
      "key_hash": "4355a46b19d348dc2f57c046f8ef63d4538ebb936000f3c9ee954a27460dd865",
      "shared_to": [],
      "subtoken_added_at": "2020-03-28T16:30:04.644008111Z",
      "subtoken_expires_at": "2021-03-28T16:30:04.644008111Z",
      "account": "OurAccount.5678"
    }
  ],
  "friends": []
}
```

### Example: with friends

This is an example that includes some subtokens for friends that were shared with one of our `x-auth-keys`.

```json
{
  "keys": [
    {
      "key_hash": "01ba4719c80b6fe911b091a7c05124b64eeece964e09c058ef8f9805daca546b",
      "shared_to": [],
      "subtoken_added_at": "2020-03-28T16:29:04.644008111Z",
      "subtoken_expires_at": "2021-03-28T16:29:04.644008111Z",
      "account": "OurAccount.1234"
    },
    {
      "key_hash": "4355a46b19d348dc2f57c046f8ef63d4538ebb936000f3c9ee954a27460dd865",
      "shared_to": [],
      "subtoken_added_at": "2020-03-28T16:30:04.644008111Z",
      "subtoken_expires_at": "2021-03-28T16:30:04.644008111Z",
      "account": "OurAccount.5678"
    }
  ],
  "friends": [
    {
      "account": "Friend.1234",
      "subtoken": "long.jwt.token.here",
      "expires_at": "2021-04-28T17:25:00.181828132Z",
      "shared_with": [
        "01ba4719c80b6fe911b091a7c05124b64eeece964e09c058ef8f9805daca546b"
      ]
    },
    {
      "account": "Friend.5678",
      "subtoken": "another.long.jwt.token.here",
      "expires_at": "2021-04-28T17:45:00.000000000Z",
      "shared_with": [
        "01ba4719c80b6fe911b091a7c05124b64eeece964e09c058ef8f9805daca546b",
        "4355a46b19d348dc2f57c046f8ef63d4538ebb936000f3c9ee954a27460dd865"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Endpoints

The API supports the following endpoints:

- GET /state
- POST /key/add
- POST /key/share
- POST /key/unshare

### GET /state

The state endpoint returns the data described in the [State](#State) section above.

In case `subtoken_added_at` in `keys` is null, use `/key/add_subtoken` to add a subtoken or that key will not have any
data retrieved.

### POST /key/add

This endpoint adds a subtoken for a key. This subtoken may be updated later, we recommend
doing that when the expiration is less than 6 months away.

#### Params

- `key_hash` – key hash
- `subtoken` – GW2 API subtoken; see requirements below

#### Subtoken requirements

The subtoken expiration date has to be at least 300 days away, we recommend making it as long as possible
(the GW2 API caps the expiration at 1 year).

##### Permissions
- `account`
- `progression`

##### Urls
The subtoken urls have to be restricted, and have to include the following urls:

- /v2/tokeninfo – used to verify token validity
- /v2/account – used to access account name, this is never shared further to avoid impersonation
- /v2/account/achievements – may be used in the future to add features that require checking achievements
- /v2/account/dungeons – may be used in the future for dungeon clears
- /v2/account/worldbosses – may be used in the future for world boss clears (unlikely)
- /v2/account/createsubtoken – used to further restrict information when sharing to friends
- /v2/account/masteries – used to access the `last_modified` information with minimal information leaks about the
  account.
- /v2/account/raids – used to access raid clear status

The token is rejected with status code 400 if these requirements are not fulfilled.

### POST /key/share

Allows a friend to access the clears of a key.

#### Params

- `key_hash` – key hash
- `account` – account name of the friend; anyone who has an api key with this account name gains access

### POST /key/unshare

Revokes the access to the clears of a key for a friend. Note that it may take up to a day to lose access because of
subtoken expiration times.

#### Params

- `key_hash` – key hash
- `account` – account name of the friend; having an api key with this account name is no longer sufficient to gain
  access
